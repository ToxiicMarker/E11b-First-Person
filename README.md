# E11b-First-Person

In this assignment I learned how to make a player model for a first person game. I imported a weapon model to simulate the apparence of a first person shooter and positioned the weapon as so. I had trouble getting my script to work as when I moved my mouse my view did not rotate as it should have in the x and y directions corresponding to my mouse movemnt and the keyboard inputs seemed to not be detected either. I feel like I might have not capitalized something or put a node in the wrong position or order. I based my assignment on the video provided and looked at the website for reference and noticed that they named their Pivot node differently on the website and had an exta onready var at the start of the code. I hope that putting the $Pivot is equivilent as the other code looked mostly the same with the exception of that difference.
